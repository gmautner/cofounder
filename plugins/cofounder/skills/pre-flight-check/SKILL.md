name: Pre-Flight Check
description: >
  This skill should be used at the very start of every session and when the
  user asks to "check my environment", "run a pre-flight check", "validate
  setup requirements", "is my system ready", or before any cofounder project
  initialization. It verifies the working directory is not the home folder
  and no pre-existing untracked content conflicts with setup. It runs after
  computer-setup and before repo-setup.

# Pre-Flight Check

Validate that the current environment is suitable for project initialization
before running any other cofounder skill.

## When to Run

Execute the pre-flight check **after computer-setup and before repo-setup**.
If the check fails, report the failure reasons to the user and stop — do not
attempt to proceed with setup.

## Running the Check

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/pre-flight-check/scripts/preflight.sh
```

The script exits `0` and prints `PREFLIGHT_PASSED` on success, or exits `1` and
prints `PREFLIGHT_FAILED` followed by one or more error lines on failure.

## Conditions Checked

### 1. Must Not Be in the Home Directory

Running from the user's home folder (`~`) risks polluting it with project files.

**On failure:** Recommend creating and navigating to a project subfolder first
(e.g., `mkdir ~/my-project && cd ~/my-project`).

### 2. No Pre-Existing Content Without a Git Repository

When **both** of these conditions are true simultaneously, the check fails:

- The directory contains files or folders other than `.claude` and `.venv`
- No local git repository has been initialized (`.git/` does not exist)

This prevents accidentally initializing a project on top of untracked existing
content.

**On failure:** Suggest using an empty directory, or initializing a git
repository first to acknowledge the existing content.

## Handling Failures

When the pre-flight check fails:

1. Display each error reason to the user in plain language
2. Provide the recommended remediation for each failure
3. **Do not proceed** with any setup skills — wait for the user to fix the
   environment and re-run the check

## Bundled Resources

### Scripts

- **`scripts/preflight.sh`** — Runs all environment validations and reports pass/fail with specific error codes
