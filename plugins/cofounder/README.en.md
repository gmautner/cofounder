# Cofounder

A [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin that acts as your co-founder — guiding you from idea to deployed web app, even if you've never written a line of code.

## Before you start

### macOS

1. Open Terminal and run:

   ```
   xcode-select --install
   ```

   This installs Git and other required command-line tools.

2. Install Claude:
   - [Claude Desktop](https://claude.com/download) (recommended) — or
   - [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) (command line)

### Windows

1. Install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.com/download) (recommended) or [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) (command line).

2. Install Git: in Claude Desktop, select the **Code** tab (**Control+3**) — it will display a message with a link to install Git for Windows. Follow the link and accept all defaults (the famous Next/Next/.../Finish).

3. Enable WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux):
   1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator**
   2. Run `wsl --install`
   3. Reboot the computer

   After rebooting, run `wsl --status` and verify it shows "Default Version: 2". A second `wsl --install` run may be needed in some cases.

## What it does

Cofounder is an AI-powered co-founder that helps you:

- **Describe your idea** in plain language and get a structured Product Requirements Document
- **Build a full-stack web app** (Go + React + PostgreSQL) with guided development
- **Test your app** with automated end-to-end testing via Playwright
- **Deploy to the cloud** on Locaweb Cloud with GitHub Actions CI/CD

It handles environment setup, dependency management, Git/GitHub workflows, database containers, and deployment — explaining everything in accessible language along the way.

## Demo

![Cofounder installation and usage on Claude Desktop](demo.webp)

This sets up the cofounder agent as the main thread for your project. From that point on, every Claude Code session in the project will automatically start with the cofounder managing your environment, requirements, and development workflow.

The setting is saved in `.claude/settings.json`, which you can commit to git so all collaborators get the same experience (they need the cofounder plugin installed too).

The agent will:

1. Set up your development environment (devbox, podman, GitHub repo)
2. Ask what you want to build
3. Create a PRD, generate tasks, and start building
4. Guide you through testing and deployment

Just describe what you want in your own words — no technical knowledge required.
